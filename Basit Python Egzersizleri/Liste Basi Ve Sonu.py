#Write a program that takes a list of numbers (for example, a = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25])
#and makes a new list of only the first and last elements of the given list.
#For practice, write this code inside a function.


def liste (c):
    b = []
    for i in c:
        b.append(i)
    print( [c[0],c[4]])
a=[11,13,14,16,17]
liste(a)
